# sudoku

This is an augmented reality program that solve a sudoku puzzle.

https://github.com/triksh/sudoku/issues/1 
some pictures to give you an idea of what it does.

For digit recognition I have used knn classifier.

I have implemented this using opencv3.0 via a c++ language.

To run the project make sure you have copied the images to appropiate location(make changes wherever required).
